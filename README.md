# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem Definition
As a student at my school, I have noticed that there is no dedicated social network for book enthusiasts for our school community. My friends and I have expressed a desire for a platform where we can connect with other students who share our love of books, share recommendations, and discuss our favorite books (see <a href="https://github.com/jonathanye29/unit4_project#evidence-of-consultation">Evidence of Consultation</a> in Appendix). Existing social media platforms such as Google Goodreads are great for readers to connect worldwide, however, it does not provide a focused space for book enthusiasts specifically within my school community. I believe that a dedicated social network for book lovers for specifically my school community would create a great space for students to connect, provide recommendations, and have discussions.
